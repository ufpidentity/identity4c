UFP Identity C library

Build & install by running:
 * ./autogen.sh
 * ./configure
 * make
 * make install-strip

If you don't have access to "sudo", you have to manually become "root"
prior to calling "make install-strip".

This library requires OpenSSL and libxml2. Two additional libraries
are included as source

* [StrMap](http://pokristensson.com/strmap.html)
* [picohttpparser](https://github.com/h2o/picohttpparser)

For testing standalone you can build an executable for debugging

gcc -ggdb -I /usr/include/libxml2/ -I /usr/include/openssl/ -o identity identity.c identity-openssl-bridge.c strmap.c identity-resolver.c picohttpparser.c identity-xml-parser.c -lssl -lcrypto -lxml2
